# Movie-Search-App
Movie app is a movie-based web project. It is coded in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows information about the different movies released.
In this tutorial, we will be creating a simple movie app. First, we need to create a folder with HTML, CSS, and js files. This projectâ€™s functionality is made with Javascript.
The movie app project has a simple layout with grid boxes. There is a search box in the top right corner
When the movie box-shadow has hovered you will see the movie information. The movie information displays with animation from bottom to top
The project shows movie ratings with different colors and numbers. We will be using a movie API which will give access to our movie app project
You need to run the index.html file in the browser to run the project. See the screenshot below.
